  // to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their

  // Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
  // sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
  // "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
  // address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
  // address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
  // used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and
  // "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
  // an address can be selected based on the language.
  //
  // The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
  // of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
  // address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
  // approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
  // made about any of the address components until it was at least
  // partially resolved.
  //
  // Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
  // then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
  // addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be
  // localities or administrative areas).
